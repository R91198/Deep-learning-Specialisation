# Deep-learning-Specialisation

### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
#### This first course of the specialisation was all about getting into Deep Learning from scratch. The way Andrew Ng teaches you the concepts and the maths behind all the forward and backward propagation and how the matrices work in each hidden layer of the Neural Networks is exceptional. Within a few days, from being a neophyte in Deep learning, I felt like my conceptual and applied knowledge regarding the same was being enhanced every day.

Week 1: Introduction to Deep Learning\
Week 2: Neural Networks Basics\
Week 3: Shallow Neural Networks\
Week 4: Deep Neural Networks


### Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
#### This course teaches the "magic" of getting Deep Learning to work well. As the name says, it surely tells us how we can improve our neural networks architecture and how can we be able to implement common neural networks tricks such as Initialization, L2 and Dropout Regularization, Batch Normalization, Gradient Check, Mini-Batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and many more.

Week 1: Practical Aspects of Deep learning\
Week 2: Optimization Algorithms\
Week 3: Hyperparameter Tuning, Batch Normalizaton and Programming Frameworks


### Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
#### Much of this course was about how we can achieve or overcome Human-level performance in some of the high-end Machine learning tasks and projects. This course also has two "flight simulators" that let us practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. This provides "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.

Week 1: ML Strategy (1)\
Week 2: ML Strategy (2)


### Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
#### If you ask me, this is the best and most important course of the entire specialisation. It teaches and gives us an indepth intuition of how the things actually work in the backend of various CNN models that detect objects, or detect faces, or just a random image classification or a face verification system, this course has it all.

Week 1: Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks\
Week 2: Deep Convolutional Models (case studies)\
Week 3: Object detection\
Week 4: Special Applications (Face Recognition and Neural Style Transfer)


### Course 5: Sequence Models


Week 1: Recurrent Neural Networks\
Week 2: Natural Language Processing and Word Embeddings\
Week 3: Various Sequence to Sequence Architectures
